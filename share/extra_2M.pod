=head1 NAME

extra_2M.db - database with special planar difference set samples

=head1 VERSION

This is version 3.0 of the database, created on May 06, 2023.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is a supplement to the default database distributed
with the Perl 5 module Math::DifferenceSet::Planar.

It contains some cyclic planar difference sets with millions of elements
together with space metadata.  Currently, these are the standard reference
sets of orders 2096993 and 2097023.

The total numbers of cyclic planar differerence sets of orders
2096993 and 2097023 are 6,445,655,386,288,147,189,605,602, and
6,383,441,485,627,927,292,616,300, respectively.  Standard reference
sets are used to calculate unique I<lambda> and I<theta> values
identifying each set.  For example, the planar difference set generated
from the primitive polynomial I<x^3+x-11 (mod 4,397,381,739,043)>
is the first set, multiplied by I<549,196,322,429 [lambda]>, plus
I<1,841,964,303,308 [theta]>.

=head1 DATA REPRESENTATION

If I<D = { d_1, d_2, ..., d_k } (mod m)> is a canonical cyclic planar
difference set of order I<k - 1> with I<d_1 E<8801> 0> and I<d_2 E<8801>
1 (mod m)>, and I<M = { m_1, m_2, ..., m_n } (mod m)> is the set of
main elements of its plane, I<delta_main> is a sequence of I<m> numeric
values packed in C<'w*'> format, calculated as differences of consecutive
residue values of I<M> starting with I<m_1>, I<m_2 - m_1>, I<m_3 - m_2>,
... up to I<m_n - m_(n-1)>.  I<D> can be recovered from I<M> by adding
derived and fill elements.

In addition to an arbitrary sample the database can hold various types of
reference sets for each order.  They are encoded by a rotation value with
respect to the sample set.  If a standard set, a lexically minimal set,
or a top-to-bottom lexically minimal set are known, nonzero I<ref_std>,
I<ref_lex>, or I<ref_gap> values refer to them, otherwise zero values
indicate their respective lack.

If a multiplier set of the form I<{b^k | 0 E<8804> k E<lt> e}>
with a radix I<b> and depth I<e>, and a rotator base of the form
I<{r_1^j_1E<183>r_2^j_2E<183>...E<183>r_n^j_n>
I<| 0 E<8804> j_k E<lt> e_k, 1 E<8804> k E<8804> n}>
with I<n> radices I<r_k> and I<n> depths I<e_k> describe the
multiplicative space of difference set planes of a given order,
I<rot_radices> and I<rot_depths> are vectors of rotation radices and
depths packed in C<'w*'> format.

For both difference set data tables, the database_version table contains
schema version information to facilitate quick compatibility checks.
A schema version of x.y is represented as major = x and minor = y.
