This library is a part of the Math-DifferenceSet-Planar project.
It is maintained in these repositories:

* perl-Math-DifferenceSet-Planar

  The base library with everything needed to create its CPAN distribution.
  Also the place where changes and new features are discussed.

* perl-Math-DifferenceSet-Planar-Data-M

  An extension that deploys a somewhat larger database of precomputed
  data to a place where it will be found by the base library.

* perl-Math-DifferenceSet-Planar-Data-L

  An extension that deploys a significantly larger database of precomputed
  data to a place where it will be found by the base library.  It covers
  all orders that can be handled with 32-bit integer arithmetic.

* perl-Math-DifferenceSet-Planar-Data-XL

  An extension that deploys the largest currently available database of
  precomputed data to a place where it will be found by the base library.
